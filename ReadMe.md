## My process
I started by watching each of the sections ahead before starting out, toget an understanding of what was being done, i then started to code along while ensuring i understood the reasons behind every code throoughly and would constantly take out some to see what effect they had on the design and this process also helped me clean up my code. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Creating Rows and columns with flexbox
- A better Understanding of flexbox properties
- Creating the lines in each column
 while exempting one using pseudo classes
```css
.pricing-plan:last-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```

### Continued development

Continuous CSS practice.

### Useful resources
